// Initable is implemented by objects that can fail during initialization. If an
// object implements this interface then it must be initialized as the first
// thing after construction, either via g_initable_init() or
// g_async_initable_init_async() (the latter is only available if it also
// implements Initable).
//
// If the object is not initialized, or initialization returns with an error,
// then all operations on the object except g_object_ref() and g_object_unref()
// are considered to be invalid, and have undefined behaviour. They will often
// fail with g_critical() or g_warning(), but this must not be relied on.
//
// Users of objects implementing this are not intended to use the interface
// method directly, instead it will be used automatically in various ways. For C
// applications you generally just call g_initable_new() directly, or indirectly
// via a foo_thing_new() wrapper. This will call g_initable_init() under the
// cover, returning NULL and setting a #GError on failure (at which point the
// instance is unreferenced).
//
// For bindings in languages where the native constructor supports exceptions
// the binding could check for objects implementing GInitable during normal
// construction and automatically initialize them, throwing an exception on
// failure.
