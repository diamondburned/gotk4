// TestDBus: helper class for testing code which uses D-Bus without touching the
// user's session bus.
//
// Note that DBus modifies the user’s environment, calling setenv(). This is not
// thread-safe, so all DBus calls should be completed before threads are
// spawned, or should have appropriate locking to ensure no access conflicts to
// environment variables shared between DBus and other threads.
//
//
// Creating unit tests using GTestDBus
//
// Testing of D-Bus services can be tricky because normally we only ever run
// D-Bus services over an existing instance of the D-Bus daemon thus we usually
// don't activate D-Bus services that are not yet installed into the target
// system. The DBus object makes this easier for us by taking care of the lower
// level tasks such as running a private D-Bus daemon and looking up uninstalled
// services in customizable locations, typically in your source code tree.
//
// The first thing you will need is a separate service description file for the
// D-Bus daemon. Typically a services subdirectory of your tests directory is a
// good place to put this file.
//
// The service file should list your service along with an absolute path to the
// uninstalled service executable in your source tree. Using autotools we would
// achieve this by adding a file such as my-server.service.in in the services
// directory and have it processed by configure.
//
//    [D-BUS Service]
//    Name=org.gtk.GDBus.Examples.ObjectManager
//    Exec=abs_top_builddir@/gio/tests/gdbus-example-objectmanager-server
//
// You will also need to indicate this service directory in your test fixtures,
// so you will need to pass the path while compiling your test cases. Typically
// this is done with autotools with an added preprocessor flag specified to
// compile your tests such as:
//
//       -DTEST_SERVICES=\""$(abs_top_builddir)/tests/services"\"
//
//    Once you have a service definition file which is local to your source tree,
//
// you can proceed to set up a GTest fixture using the DBus scaffolding.
//
// An example of a test fixture for D-Bus services can be found here:
// gdbus-test-fixture.c
// (https://git.gnome.org/browse/glib/tree/gio/tests/gdbus-test-fixture.c)
//
// Note that these examples only deal with isolating the D-Bus aspect of your
// service. To successfully run isolated unit tests on your service you may need
// some additional modifications to your test case fixture. For example; if your
// service uses GSettings and installs a schema then it is important that your
// test service not load the schema in the ordinary installed location (chances
// are that your service and schema files are not yet installed, or worse; there
// is an older version of the schema file sitting in the install location).
//
// Most of the time we can work around these obstacles using the environment.
// Since the environment is inherited by the D-Bus daemon created by DBus and
// then in turn inherited by any services the D-Bus daemon activates, using the
// setup routine for your fixture is a practical place to help sandbox your
// runtime environment. For the rather typical GSettings case we can work around
// this by setting GSETTINGS_SCHEMA_DIR to the in tree directory holding your
// schemas in the above fixture_setup() routine.
//
// The GSettings schemas need to be locally pre-compiled for this to work. This
// can be achieved by compiling the schemas locally as a step before running
// test cases, an autotools setup might do the following in the directory
// holding schemas:
//
//        all-am:
//                $(GLIB_COMPILE_SCHEMAS) .
//
//        CLEANFILES += gschemas.compiled.
