// FileMeasureProgressCallback: this callback type is used by
// g_file_measure_disk_usage() to make periodic progress reports when measuring
// the amount of disk spaced used by a directory.
//
// These calls are made on a best-effort basis and not all types of #GFile
// will support them. At the minimum, however, one call will always be made
// immediately.
//
// In the case that there is no support, reporting will be set to FALSE (and
// the other values undefined) and no further calls will be made. Otherwise,
// the reporting will be TRUE and the other values all-zeros during the first
// (immediate) call. In this way, you can know which type of progress UI to show
// without a delay.
//
// For g_file_measure_disk_usage() the callback is made directly. For
// g_file_measure_disk_usage_async() the callback is made via the default main
// context of the calling thread (ie: the same way that the final async result
// would be reported).
//
// current_size is in the same units as requested by the operation (see
// G_FILE_MEASURE_APPARENT_SIZE).
//
// The frequency of the updates is implementation defined, but is ideally about
// once every 200ms.
//
// The last progress callback may or may not be equal to the final result.
// Always check the async result to get the final value.
