// InputMessage: structure used for scatter/gather data input when receiving
// multiple messages or packets in one go. You generally pass in an array of
// empty Vectors and the operation will use all the buffers as if they were one
// buffer, and will set bytes_received to the total number of bytes received
// across all Vectors.
//
// This structure closely mirrors struct mmsghdr and struct msghdr from the
// POSIX sockets API (see man 2 recvmmsg).
//
// If address is non-NULL then it is set to the source address the message was
// received from, and the caller must free it afterwards.
//
// If control_messages is non-NULL then it is set to an array of control
// messages received with the message (if any), and the caller must free it
// afterwards. num_control_messages is set to the number of elements in this
// array, which may be zero.

// Flags relevant to this message will be returned in flags. For example,
// MSG_EOR or MSG_TRUNC.

// An instance of this type is always passed by reference.
