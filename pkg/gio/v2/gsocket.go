// Socket is a low-level networking primitive. It is a more or less direct
// mapping of the BSD socket API in a portable GObject based API. It supports
// both the UNIX socket implementations and winsock2 on Windows.
//
// #GSocket is the platform independent base upon which the higher level network
// primitives are based. Applications are not typically meant to use it
// directly, but rather through classes like Client, Service and Connection.
// However there may be cases where direct use of #GSocket is useful.
//
// #GSocket implements the #GInitable interface, so if it is manually
// constructed by e.g. g_object_new() you must call g_initable_init() and check
// the results before using the object. This is done automatically in
// g_socket_new() and g_socket_new_from_fd(), so these functions can return
// NULL.
//
// Sockets operate in two general modes, blocking or non-blocking. When in
// blocking mode all operations (which don’t take an explicit blocking
// parameter) block until the requested operation is finished or there is an
// error. In non-blocking mode all calls that would block return immediately
// with a G_IO_ERROR_WOULD_BLOCK error. To know when a call would successfully
// run you can call g_socket_condition_check(), or g_socket_condition_wait().
// You can also use g_socket_create_source() and attach it to a Context to get
// callbacks when I/O is possible. Note that all sockets are always set to non
// blocking mode in the system, and blocking mode is emulated in GSocket.
//
// When working in non-blocking mode applications should always be able to
// handle getting a G_IO_ERROR_WOULD_BLOCK error even when some other function
// said that I/O was possible. This can easily happen in case of a race
// condition in the application, but it can also happen for other reasons. For
// instance, on Windows a socket is always seen as writable until a write
// returns G_IO_ERROR_WOULD_BLOCK.
//
// #GSockets can be either connection oriented or datagram based. For connection
// oriented types you must first establish a connection by either connecting to
// an address or accepting a connection from another address. For connectionless
// socket types the target/source address is specified or received in each I/O
// operation.
//
// All socket file descriptors are set to be close-on-exec.
//
// Note that creating a #GSocket causes the signal SIGPIPE to be ignored for the
// remainder of the program. If you are writing a command-line utility that uses
// #GSocket, you may need to take into account the fact that your program will
// not automatically be killed if it tries to write to stdout after it has been
// closed.
//
// Like most other APIs in GLib, #GSocket is not inherently thread safe. To use
// a #GSocket concurrently from multiple threads, you must implement your own
// locking.

// SendMessages: send multiple data messages from socket in one go. This is the
// most complicated and fully-featured version of this call. For easier use, see
// g_socket_send(), g_socket_send_to(), and g_socket_send_message().
//
// messages must point to an array of Message structs and num_messages must be
// the length of this array. Each Message contains an address to send the data
// to, and a pointer to an array of Vector structs to describe the buffers that
// the data to be sent for each message will be gathered from. Using multiple
// Vectors is more memory-efficient than manually copying data from multiple
// sources into a single buffer, and more network-efficient than making multiple
// calls to g_socket_send(). Sending multiple messages in one go avoids the
// overhead of making a lot of syscalls in scenarios where a lot of data packets
// need to be sent (e.g. high-bandwidth video streaming over RTP/UDP), or where
// the same data needs to be sent to multiple recipients.
//
// flags modify how the message is sent. The commonly available arguments for
// this are available in the MsgFlags enum, but the values there are the same as
// the system values, and the flags are passed in as-is, so you can pass in
// system-specific flags too.
//
// If the socket is in blocking mode the call will block until there is space
// for all the data in the socket queue. If there is no space available and the
// socket is in non-blocking mode a G_IO_ERROR_WOULD_BLOCK error will be
// returned if no data was written at all, otherwise the number of messages sent
// will be returned. To be notified when space is available, wait for the
// G_IO_OUT condition. Note though that you may still receive
// G_IO_ERROR_WOULD_BLOCK from g_socket_send() even if you were previously
// notified of a G_IO_OUT condition. (On Windows in particular, this is very
// common due to the way the underlying APIs work.)
