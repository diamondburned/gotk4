// Socket is a low-level networking primitive. It is a more or less direct
// mapping of the BSD socket API in a portable GObject based API. It supports
// both the UNIX socket implementations and winsock2 on Windows.
//
// #GSocket is the platform independent base upon which the higher level network
// primitives are based. Applications are not typically meant to use it
// directly, but rather through classes like Client, Service and Connection.
// However there may be cases where direct use of #GSocket is useful.
//
// #GSocket implements the #GInitable interface, so if it is manually
// constructed by e.g. g_object_new() you must call g_initable_init() and check
// the results before using the object. This is done automatically in
// g_socket_new() and g_socket_new_from_fd(), so these functions can return nil.
//
// Sockets operate in two general modes, blocking or non-blocking. When in
// blocking mode all operations (which don’t take an explicit blocking
// parameter) block until the requested operation is finished or there is an
// error. In non-blocking mode all calls that would block return immediately
// with a G_IO_ERROR_WOULD_BLOCK error. To know when a call would successfully
// run you can call g_socket_condition_check(), or g_socket_condition_wait().
// You can also use g_socket_create_source() and attach it to a Context to get
// callbacks when I/O is possible. Note that all sockets are always set to non
// blocking mode in the system, and blocking mode is emulated in GSocket.
//
// When working in non-blocking mode applications should always be able to
// handle getting a G_IO_ERROR_WOULD_BLOCK error even when some other function
// said that I/O was possible. This can easily happen in case of a race
// condition in the application, but it can also happen for other reasons. For
// instance, on Windows a socket is always seen as writable until a write
// returns G_IO_ERROR_WOULD_BLOCK.
//
// #GSockets can be either connection oriented or datagram based. For connection
// oriented types you must first establish a connection by either connecting to
// an address or accepting a connection from another address. For connectionless
// socket types the target/source address is specified or received in each I/O
// operation.
//
// All socket file descriptors are set to be close-on-exec.
//
// Note that creating a #GSocket causes the signal SIGPIPE to be ignored for the
// remainder of the program. If you are writing a command-line utility that uses
// #GSocket, you may need to take into account the fact that your program will
// not automatically be killed if it tries to write to stdout after it has been
// closed.
//
// Like most other APIs in GLib, #GSocket is not inherently thread safe. To use
// a #GSocket concurrently from multiple threads, you must implement your own
// locking.

	//
	// The @socket must be bound to a local address with g_socket_bind() and
	// must be listening for incoming connections (g_socket_listen()).
	//
	// If there are no outstanding connections then the operation will block or

	// notified of an incoming connection, wait for the G_IO_IN condition.
	Accept(cancellable Cancellable) (Socket, error)
	// Bind: when a socket is created it is attached to an address family, but
	// it doesn't have an address in this family. g_socket_bind() assigns the
	// address (sometimes called name) of the socket.
	//
	// It is generally required to bind to a local address before you can
	// receive connections. (See g_socket_listen() and g_socket_accept() ). In
	// certain situations, you may also want to bind a socket that will be used
	// to initiate connections, though this is not normally required.
	//
	// If @socket is a TCP socket, then @allow_reuse controls the setting of the
	// `SO_REUSEADDR` socket option; normally it should be true for server
	// sockets (sockets that you will eventually call g_socket_accept() on), and
	// false for client sockets. (Failing to set this flag on a server socket
	// may cause g_socket_bind() to return G_IO_ERROR_ADDRESS_IN_USE if the
	// server program is stopped and then immediately restarted.)
	//
	// If @socket is a UDP socket, then @allow_reuse determines whether or not
	// other UDP sockets can be bound to the same address at the same time. In
	// particular, you can have several UDP sockets bound to the same address,
	// and they will all receive all of the multicast and broadcast packets sent
	// to that address. (The behavior of unicast UDP packets to an address with
	// multiple listeners is not defined.)
	Bind(address SocketAddress, allowReuse bool) error
	// CheckConnectResult checks and resets the pending connect error for the
	// socket. This is used to check for errors when g_socket_connect() is used
	// in non-blocking mode.
	CheckConnectResult() error
	// Close closes the socket, shutting down any active connection.
	//
	// Closing a socket does not wait for all outstanding I/O operations to
	// finish, so the caller should not rely on them to be guaranteed to
	// complete even if the close returns with no error.
	//
	// Once the socket is closed, all other operations will return
	// G_IO_ERROR_CLOSED. Closing a socket multiple times will not return an
	// error.
	//
	// Sockets will be automatically closed when the last reference is dropped,
	// but you might want to call this function to make sure resources are
	// released as early as possible.
	//
	// Beware that due to the way that TCP works, it is possible for
	// recently-sent data to be lost if either you close a socket while the
	// G_IO_IN condition is set, or else if the remote connection tries to send
	// something to you after you close the socket but before it has finished
	// reading all of the data you sent. There is no easy generic way to avoid
	// this problem; the easiest fix is to design the network protocol such that
	// the client will never send data "out of turn". Another solution is for
	// the server to half-close the connection by calling g_socket_shutdown()
	// with only the @shutdown_write flag set, and then wait for the client to
	// notice this and close its side of the connection, after which the server
	// can safely call g_socket_close(). (This is what Connection does if you
	// call g_tcp_connection_set_graceful_disconnect(). But of course, this only
	// works if the client will close its connection after the server does.)
