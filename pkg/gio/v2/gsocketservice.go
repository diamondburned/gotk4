// SocketService is an object that represents a service that is provided to the
// network or over local sockets. When a new connection is made to the service
// the Service::incoming signal is emitted.
//
// A Service is a subclass of Listener and you need to add the addresses you
// want to accept connections on with the Listener APIs.
//
// There are two options for implementing a network service based on Service.
// The first is to create the service using g_socket_service_new() and to
// connect to the Service::incoming signal. The second is to subclass Service
// and override the default signal handler implementation.
//
// In either case, the handler must immediately return, or else it will block
// additional incoming connections from being serviced. If you are interested in
// writing connection handlers that contain blocking code then see
// SocketService.
//
// The socket service runs on the main loop of the [thread-default
// context][g-main-context-push-thread-default-context] of the thread it is
// created in, and is not threadsafe in general. However, the calls to start and
// stop the service are thread-safe so these can be used from threads that
// handle incoming clients.
