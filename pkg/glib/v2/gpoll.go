// internally by Context, but it can be called directly if you need to block
// until a file descriptor is ready, but don't want to run the full main loop.

// Each element of fds is a FD describing a single file descriptor to poll. The
// fd field indicates the file descriptor, and the events field indicates the
// events to poll for. On return, the revents fields will be filled with the

//
// On POSIX systems, the file descriptors in fds can be any sort of file
// descriptor, but the situation is much more complicated on Windows. If you
// need to use g_poll() in code that has to run on Windows, the easiest solution
// is to construct all of your FDs with g_io_channel_win32_make_pollfd().
