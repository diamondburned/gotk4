// TreeModel interface defines a generic tree interface for use by the TreeView
// widget. It is an abstract interface, and is designed to be usable with any
// appropriate data structure. The programmer just has to implement this
// interface on their own data type for it to be viewable by a TreeView widget.
//
// The model is represented as a hierarchical tree of strongly-typed, columned
// data. In other words, the model can be seen as a tree where every node has
// different values depending on which column is being queried. The type of data
// found in a column is determined by using the GType system (ie. TYPE_INT,
// K_TYPE_BUTTON, TYPE_POINTER, etc). The types are homogeneous per column
// across all nodes. It is important to note that this interface only provides a
// way of examining a model and observing changes. The implementation of each
// individual model decides how and if changes are made.
//
// In order to make life simpler for programmers who do not need to write their
// own specialized model, two generic models are provided — the TreeStore and
// the ListStore. To use these, the developer simply pushes data into these
// models as necessary. These models provide the data structure as well as all
// appropriate tree interfaces. As a result, implementing drag and drop,
// sorting, and storing data is trivial. For the vast majority of trees and
// lists, these two models are sufficient.
//
// Models are accessed on a node/column level of granularity. One can query for
// the value of a model at a certain node and a certain column on that node.
// There are two structures used to reference a particular node in a model. They
// are the TreePath-struct and the TreeIter-struct (“iter” is short for
// iterator). Most of the interface consists of operations on a TreeIter-struct.
//
// A path is essentially a potential node. It is a location on a model that may
// or may not actually correspond to a node on a specific model. The
// TreePath-struct can be converted into either an array of unsigned integers or
// a string. The string form is a list of numbers separated by a colon. Each
// number refers to the offset at that level. Thus, the path 0 refers to the
// root node and the path 2:4 refers to the fifth child of the third node.
//
// By contrast, a TreeIter-struct is a reference to a specific node on a
// specific model. It is a generic struct with an integer and three generic
// pointers. These are filled in by the model in a model-specific way. One can
// convert a path to an iterator by calling gtk_tree_model_get_iter(). These
// iterators are the primary way of accessing a model and are similar to the
// iterators used by TextBuffer. They are generally statically allocated on the
// stack and only used for a short time. The model interface defines a set of
// operations using them for navigating the model.
//
// It is expected that models fill in the iterator with private data. For
// example, the ListStore model, which is internally a simple linked list,
// stores a list node in one of the pointers. The TreeModelSort stores an array
// and an offset in two of the pointers. Additionally, there is an integer
// field. This field is generally filled with a unique stamp per model. This
// stamp is for catching errors resulting from using invalid iterators with a
// model.
//
// The lifecycle of an iterator can be a little confusing at first. Iterators
// are expected to always be valid for as long as the model is unchanged (and
// doesn’t emit a signal). The model is considered to own all outstanding
// iterators and nothing needs to be done to free them from the user’s point of
// view. Additionally, some models guarantee that an iterator is valid for as
// long as the node it refers to is valid (most notably the TreeStore and
// ListStore). Although generally uninteresting, as one always has to allow for
// the case where iterators do not persist beyond a signal, some very important
// performance enhancements were made in the sort model. As a result, the
// K_TREE_MODEL_ITERS_PERSIST flag was added to indicate this behavior.
//
// To help show some common operation of a model, some examples are provided.
// The first example shows three ways of getting the iter at the location 3:2:5.
// While the first method shown is easier, the second is much more common, as
// you often get paths from callbacks.

//
// The TreeModel interface contains two methods for reference counting:
// gtk_tree_model_ref_node() and gtk_tree_model_unref_node(). These two methods
// are optional to implement. The reference counting is meant as a way for views
// to let models know when nodes are being displayed. TreeView will take a
// reference on a node when it is visible, which means the node is either in the
// toplevel or expanded. Being displayed does not mean that the node is
// currently directly visible to the user in the viewport. Based on this
// reference counting scheme a caching model, for example, can decide whether or
// not to cache a node based on the reference count. A file-system based model
// would not want to keep the entire file hierarchy in memory, but just the
// folders that are currently expanded in every current view.
//
// When working with reference counting, the following rules must be taken into
// account:
//
// - Never take a reference on a node without owning a reference on its parent.
// This means that all parent nodes of a referenced node must be referenced as
// well.
//
// - Outstanding references on a deleted node are not released. This is not
// possible because the node has already been deleted by the time the
// row-deleted signal is received.
//
// - Models are not obligated to emit a signal on rows of which none of its
// siblings are referenced. To phrase this differently, signals are only
// required for levels in which nodes are referenced. For the root level
// however, signals must be emitted at all times (however the root level is
// always referenced when any view is attached).
