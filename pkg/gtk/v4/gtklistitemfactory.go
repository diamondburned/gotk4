// ListItemFactory: GtkListItemFactory creates widgets for the items taken from
// a GListModel.
//
// This is one of the core concepts of handling list widgets such as
// gtk.ListView or gtk.GridView.
//
// The GtkListItemFactory is tasked with creating widgets for items taken from
// the model when the views need them and updating them as the items displayed
// by the view change.
//
// A view is usually only able to display anything after both a factory and a
// model have been set on the view. So it is important that you do not skip this
// step when setting up your first view.
//
// Because views do not display the whole list at once but only a few items,
// they only need to maintain a few widgets at a time. They will instruct the
// GtkListItemFactory to create these widgets and bind them to the items that
// are currently displayed.
//
// As the list model changes or the user scrolls to the list, the items will
// change and the view will instruct the factory to bind the widgets to those
// new items.
//
// The actual widgets used for displaying those widgets is provided by you.
//
// When the factory needs widgets created, it will create a GtkListItem and hand
// it to your code to set up a widget for. This list item will provide various
// properties with information about what item to display and provide you with
// some opportunities to configure its behavior. See the gtk.ListItem
// documentation for further details.
//
// Various implementations of GtkListItemFactory exist to allow you different
// ways to provide those widgets. The most common implementations are
// gtk.BuilderListItemFactory which takes a GtkBuilder .ui file and then creates
// widgets and manages everything automatically from the information in that
// file and gtk.SignalListItemFactory which allows you to connect to signals
// with your own code and retain full control over how the widgets are setup and
// managed.
//
// A GtkListItemFactory is supposed to be final - that means its behavior should
// not change and the first widget created from it should behave the same way as
// the last widget created from it. If you intend to do changes to the behavior,
// it is recommended that you create a new GtkListItemFactory which will allow
// the views to recreate its widgets.
//
// Once you have chosen your factory and created it, you need to set it on the
// view widget you want to use it with, such as via gtk.ListView.SetFactory().
// Reusing factories across different views is allowed, but very uncommon.
